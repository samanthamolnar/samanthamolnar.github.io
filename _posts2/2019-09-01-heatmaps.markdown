A large part of my visualization work at NREL focuses on power system dynamics.  One extremely common, and I argue bad, way of visualizing the frequency of a power
system is via a heatmap.  For example, see the animation below [blah].
[Insert figure here].
Where did the perturbation originate? 
What system mode does this visualization display?
Where was the largest frequency deviation?
Where was the smallest frequency deviation?
