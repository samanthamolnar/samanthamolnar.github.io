I am currently a Doctoral student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I work with Professor [Liz
Bradley](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/)
and [Dr. Kenny Gruchalla](http://energysciences.nrel.gov/csc/staff/kenny_gruchalla) at the National Renewable Energy Lab. My research interests include analysis of dynamics on networks and the visualization of such systems.
Specifically, I study how the addition of renewable generation alters power system dynamics during cascading failures.
