I am currently a Doctoral student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I work with Professor Liz Bradley
as well as Dr. Kenny Gruchalla at the National Renewable Energy Lab. My major is Computer Science and my
research interests include analysis of dynamics on networks and the visualization of such systems. Recently,
I have been exploring the application of information theory on such systems.
