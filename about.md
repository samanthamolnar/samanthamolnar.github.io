I am currently a Doctoral student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I work with Professor [Liz
Bradley](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/)
as well as [Dr. Kenny Gruchalla](http://energysciences.nrel.gov/csc/staff/kenny_gruchalla) at the National Renewable Energy Lab. My major is Computer Science and my
research interests include analysis of dynamics on networks and the visualization of such systems. Recently,
I have been exploring the application of information theory on such systems.
